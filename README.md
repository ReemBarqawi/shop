## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a **Mini E-Commerce System** built with Django as part of the final General Assembly project.  
The system allows an **admin** to add, edit, and delete products (CRUD functionality),  
and will later allow **customers** to browse and view products.  

The goal is to demonstrate my understanding of:
- Django models, views, and templates (MVT)
- Authentication & authorization
- PostgreSQL integration
- Front-end design with responsive CSS
- Git workflow and version control
